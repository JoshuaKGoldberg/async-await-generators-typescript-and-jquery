# 5. Takeaways

Three main things I hope you walk away feeling:

1. State machines are awesome
2. Either an understanding of how generators work or a desire to learn more
3. GitHub Markdown is totally an acceptable presentation slide form

I have a moderately in-depth [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@joshuakgoldberg/hacking-typescripts-async-await-awaiter-for-jquery-2-s-promises-60612e293c4b) about we used this stuff in Sway to hack around jQuery/TypeScript Promise specification compatability issues.

Thanks for listening!
