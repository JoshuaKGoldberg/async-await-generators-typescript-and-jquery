2. `async`/`await`

`async`/`await` builds on top of this generator fanciness by providing a specialized syntax for generators that yield Promises.
"`await`ing" an "`async`hronous" generator is shorthand for saying that you want to capture the result of that `Promise` locally, `.then` continue with the function.

```javascript
async function getSomeAsyncValue() {
    await someOtherAsyncCode(); // returns a Promise
    return await getSomeOtherAsyncValue(); // also returns a Promise
}
```

On the inside, this is a generator (state machine) just like before.
* The first time the function is called, we call `someOtherAsyncCode();` and `await` for that to finish.
* The second time, we call `getSomeOtherAsyncValue()`, `await` for that to finish, and `return` the result.
